Project Name: 3D Pool
Project description: 
    The idea of this project is to create a pool game in 3D. 
    There are two game modes: 8 ball pool and 9 ball pool, 
    and the players will play the game alternating turns.
    There is a different win condition between the two games, 8 ball depends 
    on making the 8 ball after clearing the table of your designated "color"
    (stripes or solids), and 9 ball depends on making the 9 ball
How to run the project:
    1. Install Panda3d
    2. Put the "models" folder into the same directory as "pool redesign.py"
    3. Now the directory should have 4 things: models folder, pool redesign.py,
        ballClass.py, vectorClass.py
    4. Open the file "pool redesign" and run the file
        in whichever console / editor you are using. Then a menu screen will appear
        and you can choose between the two game modes.
List of required libraries:
    In windows: Panda3D, not sure about Mac OS
List of shortcut commands:
    None
